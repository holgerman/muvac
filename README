### INSTALLATION
1) you need to be root to install library dependencies
sudp apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cmake install git g++ gcc make openjdk-8-jdk r-base r-base-dev python-dev unzip zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libexpat1-dev
2) create a directory for muvac installation and export MUVAC variable assigned to it
mkdir -p $PWD/tools
export MUVAC=$PWD/tools
3) store exported MUVAC variable permanently to ensure that muvac can always find its tools
echo "export MUVAC=$MUVAC" >> ~/.bashrc
4) install muvac into $MUVAC directory
muvac -i all

### RUN
./muvac -v -1 R1.fastq -2 R2.fastq -g genomes/hg19.fa -o results -l results/run.log
adapt and use the terminal command above
calling for help? execute muvac -h
example for multiple patients data to be processed in parallel:
muvac -a CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT -1 patient1_1.fq,patient2_1.fq -2 patient1_2.fq,patient2_2.fq -g genomes/hg19.fa -o results -l results/run.log
### ATTENTION
make sure you have a dbSNP vcf file next to your genome.fa file named genome.fa.vcf
muvac comes with hg19.fa and corresponding vcf from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/human_9606_b149_GRCh37p13/VCF/GATK/common_all_20161121.vcf.gz

### RUN INFO
a comprehensive log file will be created in your output directory at <results>/run.log
using verbose option -v will additionally print full log to terminals stdout

### RESULTS
results can be found in the vcf directory: <results>/vcf/<mapper>/*.<caller>.vcf 
merged results are named <results>/vcf/<mapper>/*.merged.vcf
callers: freebayes, haplotypecaller, mutect2, samtools, platypus

### INTERMEDIATE RESULTS (in processing order)
fastqc) find raw read quality staistics at <results>/qualities/*
fastx_toolkit) find phred64 to phred33 quality converted raw reads at <results>/converted/*
trimmomatic)  find quality trimmed reads at <results>/trimmed/*
rcorrector) find error corrected reads at <results>/rawcorrected/*
segemehl|tophat2|bwa) find sorted mapping data at <results>/mapped/<mapper>/*.bam
picard) find duplicate marked mapping data at <results>/noduplicates/<mapper>/*.bam
gatk) find relaigned and reaclibrated mapping data at <results>/errorcorrected/<mapper>/*.reordered.bam

### HANDLING OF MULTIALLELIC REPORTS
bcftools-norm is used to split them into single reports with related genotype (GT), genotype quality (GQ) and coverage (DP)
muvac returns the best report according to 1) GQ and 2) DP

### HANDLING OF SCORES FOR MERGED OUTPUT
muvac returns the score of the first caller in alphabetic order, which is freebayes if not deactivated

### GENERAL CALLER PARAMETER
if adjustable, all callers are contrained by
min reads >= 10
allel frequency >= 0.1
alternative alleles <= 3
min base quality >= 0
max variances = all
downsampling = off
